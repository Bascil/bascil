# Basil Ndonga – Senior DevOps Engineer

I design and deploy **high-performance, scalable backend systems** that modernize legacy infrastructure and enable businesses to operate efficiently at scale. My work spans **Rust, PHP, Go, and Node.js**, focusing on **memory-safe, low-latency services**, microservices architecture, and cloud-native deployments.

## What I Do
- Modernize legacy codebases, rewriting critical components in **Rust** for improved performance, safety, and concurrency.
- Architect **multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters** and automate deployments using **Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and ArgoCD**.
- Optimize relational databases (**Postgres, MySQL**) and implement high-throughput queue systems using **Redis & Laravel Horizon**.
- Build **production-grade microservices** and backend APIs with PHP, Rust, and Node.js.
  
## Skills
**Languages & Frameworks:** Rust, PHP, Go, Node.js, TypeScript, Laravel, Actix, Next.js, Vue.js, Redux  
**Databases:** Postgres, MySQL, Redis, NoSQL  
**DevOps & Cloud:** Linux, Bash, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Kustomize, ArgoCD, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, GKE  
**Observability:** Promtail, Loki, Grafana  
**Principles:** Data Structures, Algorithms, OS Concepts, Microservices, Design Patterns, OOP, DDD, SOLID  

## Projects
- **SERVERCRUST:** Cloud platform for servers, IPs, domains, and managed databases ([servercrust.com](https://servercrust.com))  

## Interests
Memory management, concurrency, database optimization, cloud-native architecture, event sourcing, Rust borrow checker, OS internals, and high-performance systems.
